This project is in response to the assignment for Class 3:
[**Class 3 Assignment**](https://github.com/acl-nw-bootcamp/2018-winter/tree/master/week_1-2/class-03)

# Step 1
The first step was to create a branch off the master. First I had to figure out how to revert out of some changes that I had made to the file that was pushed to GitHub.

# Step 2
The second step is updating this here README folder using some of the tags we learned in class, for example:

# Here is a heading
## Here is a smaller heading
* Here is a bullet point
- Here is another bullet point
* *Here is some italic text*
* **Here is some bold text**

# Step 3
For the Class 4 assignment I created another new branch, and added more functionality to the JS code, including writing the answers to the page using the getElementById method. I also figured out how to fix the formatting issues from my first README draft by adding additional asterisks after the *italic* and **bold** texts to complete the formatting.
