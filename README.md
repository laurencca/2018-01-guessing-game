# 2018-01-guessing-game

This project is in response to the assignment for Class 3:
[**Class 3 Assignment**](https://github.com/acl-nw-bootcamp/2018-winter/tree/master/week_1-2/class-03)

# Step 1
The first step was to create a branch off the master. First I had to figure out how to revert out of some changes that I had made to the file that was pushed to GitHub.

# Step 2
The second step is updating this here README folder using some of the tags we learned in class, for example:

# Here is a heading
## Here is a smaller heading
* Here is a bullet point
- Here is another bullet point
* *Here is some italic text*
* **Here is some bold text**

# Step 3
For the Class 3 assignment I created a new branch, and added the ability to validate user input to accept uppercase or lowercase answers. I also added another question that takes numeric input, and indicates to the user whether the guess is 'too high' or 'too low'.

# Step 4
For the Class 4 assignment I created a new branch, and added functionality to write the answers to the page using the getElementById method. I also figured out how to fix the formatting issues from my first README draft by adding additional asterisks after the *italic* and **bold** texts to complete the formatting.

# Step 5
For the Class 5 assignment I created a new branch, applied D.R.Y. to my code, and added images and color coding to the questions answers. I also updated the CSS styling so the webpage looks better. I then deployed everything to GitHub Pages.
