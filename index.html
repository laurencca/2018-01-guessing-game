      <h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
      <p>I was born in Portland, and after a short stint out in the sticks, lived
        in Portland from 3rd grade through high school. I went to Alameda Elementary,
        Beaumont Middle School, and Lincoln High School. I studied Russian language
        and literature through college and grad school, went to law school for a bit
        in between, and ended up in California for about 12 years doing nothing
        whatsoever related to Russian.</p>
        <p>Last January I moved home to Oregon, bought a house in Hillsboro with my
          husband, two dogs, and cat, and have been readjusting to life in the PNW.
          In November I was laid off from my job, so I have been busy reassessing my
          career and applying for jobs.</p>

          <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
          <p>I have worked as an executive assistant, facilities manager, insurance manager
            office manager, event planner, and purchasing manager - bascially all sorts of
            administrative functions in corporate, non-profit, and educational environments.</p>
            <p><a href="#top"><span class="return">Top</span></a></p>

            <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
            <p>I have a B.A. in Russian Language and Literature from Dartmouth College, and
              an M.A. in Slavic Languages and Literatures from Stanford University. And now
              I'm studying coding at Alchemy Code Lab, and taking a course to become a
              Certified Scrum Master.</p>
              <p><a href="#top"><span class="return">Top</span></a></p>

              <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
              <p>My goals are the following:
                <ol>
                  <li>Get out of administrative work - it's so boring!</li>
                  <li>Challenge myself and learn something totally scary &amp; new - i.e., coding</li>
                  <li>Get a job that engages my brain and increases my earning potential.</li>
                </ol>
